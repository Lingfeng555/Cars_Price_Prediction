In this folder we cover the classification and regression techniques that use trees logic, such as CART, RandomForest, BayesianTrees.

We want to attack the problem by dividing the dataset into different groups, because the evaluation of the car change in each case, the parameters that are used to evaluate electric cars of combustion cars are different.
